Hello World! 

My name is Jay Vang and I am an inspiring front-end developer! I am currently enrolled
in The Odin Project; as it will guide me on my path to reach my goal! Skills I am currently
learning are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After the Odin Project, I plan on learning React.js, 
SASS, and Typescript. Please check out my projects and contribution as I journey on this path
to becoming a terrific developer!
